	exit status $? - gives you status of previous command if that was successful
	
	if you want to maintain the logging for your script, you cam use logger in your script.
	you can find the logs under 
	/var/logs/messages
	
	example - #logger "Hey Buddy"
	
	if we can enable the debugging of the script using below in the script
	set -x
